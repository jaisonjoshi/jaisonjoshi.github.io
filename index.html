                    expertise in front-end and back-end development, database management, and deployment. Additionally,
                    I have worked part-time as a developer for three months, refining my technical skills and
                    collaborating on various projects. I have also completed freelance projects, enhancing my
                    problem-solving abilities, creativity, and adaptability. </p>
